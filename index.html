            <div class="content-heading">About MS</div>
            <p>The Management Society has been consistent at being one of the most prestigious and prolific committees in Thadomal Shahani Engineering College. It also happens to be one of the oldest student bodies to exist in the college, establishing its roots in 1993.<br>
<br>
<h5>1993 – 2009</h5>
<br>
<p>The foundation of a legacy popularly referred to as the MS was performed by TSEC’s then principal, Dr. Kranti Kumar. It was found with an intention of improvising students and groom them for their further education or placements. The committee would assist students facing common dilemmas during their final years at college that often included choosing between MBA, MS, M-Tech or placement related inquiries</p>

<p>Back in the days, the MS organised its flagship festival Lakshya wherein several Seminars and Workshops apart from numerous intra-college events. Due to the guidance and vision our teaching staff and also the enthusiasm expressed by students, the activities and stature rose to heights never witnessed in the past.</p>

<p>The year 2003 witnessed the conceiving of CarMa, an acronym for Career Management. The society held the privilege to be the first and only engineering college to host a festival oriented towards career management in the city. The festival was received with much prompt and fanfare, having being featured in prominent newspapers such as the Times of India and several others.<br>
Ever since, growth of the society has been exponential. In 2009 when Ms. Anjali Malviya became the counsellor of the society, taking it to new heights altogether. The grandeur of the festivals and activities of the committee have matured and evolved in the years of her guidance, which continues even today.</p>
<br>
            <h5>2009-2011</h5>
<br>
<p>The society continued to grow as we expanded to interact with students, changing their perception amongst the crowd to be a committee dedicated to ready students for the corporate and work lives. CarMa has snowballed to become one of the biggest national level festivals that involve in numerous national level competitions, including Quizzes and Debates. The Model United Nations conferences held in CarMa are one of the most anticipated MUN conferences across the Indian circuit. With more than 20 events each having overwhelming participation and oriented towards honing the soft-skills of an individual, there was no doubting the magnitude of significance the Management Society held in the college.
The industrial visits that have been conducted by the MS have been labelled as the best in the institute by the students themselves, with 90 students being a part of tours across the country including Bangalore, Mysore, Coorg, Mangalore, Goa and the north. The unending waiting list served as a reminder to how much anticipation the IV held.<br>
Apart from the Quizzes, Panel Debates and MUN conferences, the MS has in the past organised an Entrepreneurship Conclave of young entrepreneurs giving tips to aspiring businessmen still in college. Time and motion study were concepts that were addressed to with an event, minute to win-it, an event based on the event of a popular television series of the same name.<br>
Speaktacular 2011 was a hallmark for TSEC, for the MS was able to organize, under the indispensible support of our counsellor Mrs. Anjali Malviya a national level debate that witnessed participation from seven cities in the country, including Chandigarh, Ahmedabad, New Delhi, Nagpur, pune, Gandhinagar and Mumbai. The three day event now shortened to two days was based on the Oxford-styled panel debate amongst 32 teams.
The tradition of conducting the cities best literary events that include JAM, Turncoats, MUNs, Debates and Quizzes continues up to this very year, with more than 250 newly registered members in the on-going academic year.</p>
<br>
<h5>Present Scenario</h5>
<br>
<p>As the MS is growing, it keeps up with its unconventional ways not only by doing things differently but by being the difference! With its 2nd edition of Speaktacular witnessing huger participation and quality debates, the Debate club of the MS-TSEC has made its mark. In the journey through 2012, the MS-TSEC has witnessed massive structural growth.<br>
A terrific amount of brainstorming went into the making of CarMa 2012. After rigorous discussions the events were fabricated, to bring out the best it could. Thus CarMa 2012,raising high above its bar, was the best of all its predecessors. Then came the much awaited MS industrial visit 2013, on its way to explore the desert land of Rajasthan, saw enthusiastic FEs lined up from early hours of the day much before the registrations had even begun. The registrations were full in just a few minutes and ran into a huge waiting list. As for the FEs the IV was a fun filled eight day trip, with a day spent at the industries and true to its promises the MS-IV lived up to all expectations.<br>
The year 2013, kick started with a new novel concept under the banner of its Literary Club-Scrabble tournament. This event was an intra-collegiate two day event witnessing a huge participation, among which we got to see a huge count of verbal geniuses! Post the success of its new event, the MS went on to do its 3rd edition of Speaktacular and this time not only did it witness a quantitative and qualitative participation, but also a huge audience, a rare sight for a debate event in an engineering college.<br>
The trend seems to be changing and the MS being the trend setter! The MS has evolved into an epitome of excellence and shall continue to broaden its horizons in the years to come.
<br>
<h5>Committee Structure</h5>
<br>
<p>The MS-TSEC committee carries out all its activities, visits, festivals and events under the guidance and leadership of the MS-TSEC counsellor, Ms. Anjali Malviya who continues to remain actively involved in all of its activities.

<p>CarMa, MS TSEC's flagship inter collegiate festival, is a one of its kind venture that focuses on honing the management skills of students with a plethora of management related events and games and a host of fun events as well.<br>
It is the first inter collegiate festival of the academic year. As the name suggests (CAReer MAnagement), the events in this festival tend to hone management skills in one way or the other. The events tend to have an individual’s intellect exercised amidst a sea of competition from across the nation.</p>
<p>Over the years, CARMA has opened up new vistas to explore in post-graduate study and has helped students realize their entrepreneurial potential, if not improvise their soft skills over the numerous events it hosts.<br>
CarMa witnesses participation from all across the country for the 20 plus events it hosts. The tradition of conducting the cities best literary events that include JAM, Turncoats, MUNs, Debates and Quizzes that initiated in 2003 continues up to this very year. The Model United Nations Conference that occurs during CarMa in TSEC is one of the most anticipated MUNs across the national debating circuit. Every event being a gem of its own, CarMa is a world in itself.

<p><i>“Time spent arguing is, oddly enough, almost never wasted.”</i>
<br> ― Christopher Hitchens<br>
Speaktacular, TSEC’s Annual National level Inter-Collegiate Debate, has always been about providing a stage for the present day’s youth to voice their opinions and to prove their point of view to the world. While last year’s edition set a whole new standard for debating, this year Speaktacular ups the ante yet again. Speaktacular promises to be unlike any ever seen yet, with a greater participation than any of the previous editions, topics to really send those grey cells into overtime and a quality of debate that few others can hope to match. Consisting of two days of Oxford style panel debating and only the very best teams from educational institutions all over the country coming in, the 5th and 6th of March this year are guaranteed to have an atmosphere charged with enthusiasm and competition. With over double the number of participating teams of any previous edition coming in from all over the country to bring us around to their way of thinking, Speaktacular is of a scale never seen before.

        <div class="content-heading">Industrial Visit</div>
<p>The Industrial Visit is a two-week experience that best encapsulates the spirit of the Management Society: work hard, play hard. Scheduled just after the conclusion of the gruelling semester exams, the IV is an annual excursion, organised by the MS for the students of TSEC that takes its participants across India and to the industries of the foremost organisations in the world as part of the learning experience that comes with weeks of journeying with friends.</p>

    <h5>MS-IV 2013</h5>
            <br>
<p>The MS-IV 2013 took its travellers to the snowy hills of Manali and Dalhousie, the bustle of Chandigarh and the serenity of Amritsar. The students visited the factories of P&G and Havell's along with frozen mountains, towering forests, monuments and the Golden Temple. Amidst train journeys, snowball fights, marketplaces and temples, around campfires and under snowy skies, strangers became friends and friends became family.

    <h5>MS-IV 2014</h5>
            <br>
<p>The afternoon of the 14th of October saw the registrations for the Management Society’s annual Industrial Visit close in 14 minutes flat in a flurry of beautiful chaos. The IV took the students to the North of India, visiting Amritsar, Manali, Dalhousie and Chandigarh and taking a tour of the factories of Havells India Ltd. and of Procter and Gamble, the company behind legendary products such as Oral-B, Pringles and Tide to name a few. The group travelled by train through extreme temperature zones and toothpaste-wars in the ride of a lifetime. At Chandigarh, the MS and its semester-old members walked through the vast halls and in between the towering chimneys of P&G and Havells. After the education came the entertainment and the IV only came to an end after a blizzard of laughter and adrenaline in sub-zero Manali, a spell of winter, fireside stories and relaxation at Dalhousie and the traditional awards night at Amritsar, where the group paid a visit and its respects to Jallianwala Bagh and the Golden Temple, a visit that left the travellers in awe at beauty and holiness that struck even the most hardcore atheist, the perfect end to the perfect trip. On stepping off the Golden Temple Express for the last time to get off at Mumbai, there was not a single person who would have minded stepping back on to relive what had in the last few days become memories that would be with them forever.</p>

    <h5>MS-IV 2015</h5>
            <br>
<p>In the summer, the Society organised a well-deserved excursion to the North of India with several other students. The 2015 Industrial Visit saw the group visit the factories of Godrej and Bharat Heavy Electricals as part of a 10-day excursion to Haridwar, Rishikesh, Corbett National Park and Nainital. Amidst the misty foothills of the Himalayas, above pristine lakes and inside serene forests, strangers became friends and friends became family.</p>
